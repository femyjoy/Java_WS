The Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office simplifies the task of manipulating Open XML packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package.
The SDK is built on the System.IO.Packaging API and provides strongly-typed classes to manipulate documents that adhere to the Office Open XML File Formats specification.

Office Open XML (also informally known as OOXML or Microsoft Open XML (MOX)) is a zipped, XML-based file format developed by Microsoft for representing spreadsheets, charts, presentations and word processing documents.
