Requests can be stored in a collection and teh collection can be run as a test suite
The asserts for tests are written using JS script in the 'Test' tab
tests["responsecode = 200"] = responseCode.code === 200;
tests["Response time is less than 100ms"] = responseTime < 100; 

The collection can also be run through command line using NewMan

Chrome plug in and app is the same in terms of functionality and features
But if the tool needs to be validated, then use the app version to get it validated.
