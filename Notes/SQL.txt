SET ColName = REPLACE(ColName, '123', '')
WHERE ID <= 4
AND Value LIKE '%123%'

VARCHAR, NVARCHAR - can hold letters and numbers, can be of inderterminate lenght
CHAR, NCHAR - fixed lenght
 N stands for National Language Character Set and is used to specify a Unicode string.  Unicode characters take twice space on non-unicode characters

 TRUNCATE , DROP , DELETE
 DELETE - Removes rows from table, doesnot delete table,  DML - can be rolled back before commit;has to be commited to take effect, can have WHERE clause, doesnot re-initialise table
 TRUNCATE - Removes rows from table,doesnot delete table, DDL - cannot be rolled back, cannot have WHERE clause, re-initiliazes table.
 DROP - Drops the table, all info including indexes, DDL - cannot be rolled back

 Indexing - is used to faster access of data, works like LL, indices can be based on one or multiple columns.

 JOINs - https://www.studytonight.com/dbms/joining-in-sql.php
 INNER JOIN
 To select only some columns from either tables :
 SELECT t1.col1, t1.col2,t2.col1,t2.col2 from Table1 t1 JOIN Table2 t2 ON t1.ID=t2.ID
 You may or maynot use table alias.if not using alias, use the their full name with table name.

 NATURAL JOIN - join based on column that is same datatype across both tables
 CROSS JOIN - Every combination from both tables.
 LEFT(OUTER) JOIN
 RIGHT(OUTER) JOIN
 FULL(OUTER) JOIN

 View - Virtual table based on RS of a SQL statement.
 COUNT(), AVG(), SUM() - is  done on columns and can have WHERE clause

 Multiple values in WHERE - IN
 Anding in WHERE - AND
 Oring in WHERE - OR
 Range of values in WHERE - BETWEEN value 1 AND vlaue2
 HAVING == WHERE and is used in Aggregate functions

 SELECT INTO - to copy data from one table to another.
 MERGE - combines INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE at one go -https://www.essentialsql.com/introduction-merge-statement/

 Mongo DB - Schema less, noSQL, implemented in C++
 A mongo DB server will have several collections.
 A collection is group of documents, which are schema less, emaning each document can have different fields but usually are meaningfully similar.
 Document - schema less, key-value pair, json format
 Collection == Table ; Document == Row ; Field == Column
 https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/mongodb_environment.htm
 Default data path - C:\data\db
 show dbs - shows only dbs that have atleast 1 document in it.
 use myDB -- switches if present, if not creates
 db -- shows your current db
 db.collection1.insert({}) - This creates collection1 and inserts into it.
 Alternatively, you can create explicilty : db.createCollection(collection1, options) and then db.colelciton1.insert({})
_id is unique for each document. if not mentioned explicitly mongodb will generate a unique ObjectId for the document.
 save({}) is a wrapper over update and insert, if you pass in _id, save will update, insert will throw duplicate key error. If donot pass _id, save and insert behaves the same.
 To save or insert multiple documens in one go,pass in array of documents - db.collection1.insert({},{},{})
 To find documents based on condition you can give in db.collection1.find({$and:[{},{}]}, {_id:0,col1:1}) - result will have only col1 , db.collection1.find({$or:[{},{}]})
 db.collection1.update({'colName':"blah blah"},{$set:{'coleName':"meaningful data"}})
 db.remove({'colName':"me me", 1}) - 1 indicates remove only 1 occurance that meets the criteria
 db.coll.find({}).limit(10).skip(1) - skips first record. Default value of skip is 0
 db.coll.find({},{'colName':1}).sort(1) - 1 - ASC , -1 - DESC
 Sharding - storing data on multiple servers
 Replication - synchronising data on multiple servers for back up purposes.
