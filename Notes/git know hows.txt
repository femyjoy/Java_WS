To not check in .class and other files, add them to .gitignore
If .class was initially check in and from now on you dont want to, then :

git rm --cached C:\ws_auto\localizationTest\target -r
*.class

To add a new .gitignore file to your project in windows:
Create the file .gitignore.txt
Right click on your current folder and select “open command window here” / go to cmd to this folder
Type ren .gitignore.txt .gitignore

To commit all files and push :
git commit -m "" . --> This commits all changed files
git push --> pushes all files in the directory except the ones to be ignored by .gitignore

To commit only some files : 
git commit file1, file2  -m "" 


To delete folders and its contents recursively from remote :
git rm -r --cached/-f <foldername>
